<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]]

### Details

This board allows for a theoretical 200 Watt load dissipation with datalogging to a host computer and live view on an OLED screen. The usage of an external v-ref in the DAC allows for Automatic Gain control to have finer current adjustments at lower current levels. Through software constant power loads should also be possible. 


<!-- ROADMAP -->
